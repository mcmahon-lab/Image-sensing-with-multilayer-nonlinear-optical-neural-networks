Visualize_latent_space_UMAP.ipynb

The jupyter notebook used to visualize the latent space of the linear optical encoder and the 2-layer ONN encoder with different low dimensional projection methods (UMAP, t-SNE, and DenseMAP as shown in Figure 2h). Note the train and test datasets were combined in the plots, since there is no need to distinguish train or test dataset just for the visualization of the latent space.

Dependencies:
-Train_Data_Cell_Nonlinear.npz: The 4D feature vector generated by the 2-layer nonlinear ONN encoder for the train dataset of the cell organelle dataset.
-Test_Data_Cell_Nonlinear.npz: The 4D feature vector generated by the 2-layer nonlinear ONN encoder for the test dataset of the cell organelle dataset.
-Train_Data_Cell_linear.npz: The 4D feature vector generated by the linear optical encoder for the train dataset of the cell organelle dataset.
-Test_Data_Cell_linear.npz: The 4D feature vector generated by the linear optical encoder for the test dataset of the cell organelle dataset.
