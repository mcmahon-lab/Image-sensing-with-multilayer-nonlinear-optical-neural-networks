# Optical deep neural network image sensing with optical-to-optical nonlinear activations

We constructed a multi-layer optical neural network (ONN) with two linear layers and an element-wise nonlinear layer in-between. The linear layers were each implemented with a fully optical matrix-vector multiplier, and the nonlinear layer was implemented with an image intensifier. The inputs to the ONN were light reflected either by a digital micromirror device (DMD) or a real physical object. For the task of recognizing hand-drawn figures and cell organelles, the input signal to the ONN encoder was generated by shining white-light (MNWHL4 - 4900 K, Thorlabs Inc.) onto a DMD (V-650L Vialux GmBH) that displays the image. For real scene image sensing, we used a 3D-printed model of a speed-limit traffic sign placed at an intersection, with a car and a tree in the background.
